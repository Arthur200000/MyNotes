Cross-platform .app bundle
====
At first it was a joke, or just a crazy idea.

The .app directory will has a layout almost the same to the one OS X .app
bundle has, but just with a ${OS}${ARCH}/ folder instead of the MacOS/ 
folder. Of course it can support a fat bundle with MacOS/ and many other Arches.
