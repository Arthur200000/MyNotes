A personal project for my classmates and me who use Linux as their main OS. 

Contains scripts and possibly decompiled source code (Maybe patches only?) for Linux.

Never, ever use this in your software distribution! And always make sure you have the License!

(Of course I will keep the activation stuffs in the source code...........)


boring string

Use everything here at your own risk. I am not the author, the real author is a guy called '42'.

TI-\* are always trademarks of Texas Instruments, hahaha..........	


What's going to happen
----
Of cource these things would be moved into a seperate repo one day. And those scripts would be written into the source.
